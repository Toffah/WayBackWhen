    <h2> What is The Way Back When </h2>
        <p> The Way Back When is a digital repository for all digital artefact form a specific culture.
        The idea behind this prototype is create an area where countries can proudly show and enhance their culture over the internet
            with other interested parties. These interested parties could be anything from tourists that want to get deep cultural knowledge
            of a particular country to foreign governments needing to understand the nuance of culture and language to communicate more effectively.

        <h2> How dose it work?</h2>
        <p> The repository works on a voluntary basis, where entities contribute to the repository with different artefacts.
            It is mostly geared towards governments that want to spread their culture to attract, as mentioned, for example tourism or business.
            <br> <br>
            Before explaining the example it is important to define what we mean by a digital artefact. In this context a artefact is any
            piece of medium used to explain or communicate a cultural idea. A digital artefact is then a piece of medium, such as newspapers, video, music,
            paintings, books, novels and videos that has been uploaded to the internet. This is where Way Back When comes in to sort and structure these
            artefacts.
            <br> <br>
            It could be easier to understand if we explain with an example. In this example we will use the country of Norway
            but it could technically be any country.
            <br> <br>
            If Norway were to adopt this solution it would for example add huge amount of media form the government run NRK network to the
            Way Back When repository. However, in addition it would also add important works of literature, old children songs, the national
            anthem and so on, all under a free to use licence to spur further use and growth.
            <br> <br>
            In the top right corner of the website a link to the prototype of the Way Back When repository is located, and we implore you to
            check it out. The Way Back When prototype can also be reached through clicking on this <a href="Site not added yet"> link </a>.
